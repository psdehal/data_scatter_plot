Prototype js code for displaying data in an interactive scatter plot


Quick Start

1) Start http server in root directory. 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

2) Open in web browser. Most testing has been done using Chrome: 

http://localhost:8080/DataScatter.html

3) Click on "Load Example Data" on the Title bar. This will open an example data set of Shewanella MR-1 fitness experiements.

4) The data sets are listed on the right hand side. Select at least 2 to see scatter plots. Selecting more than ~12 is a bad idea.
